# Project Description: 

We want to implement a deep super-resolution model using more modern methods, primarily transformers.

# Things to do:

1. Complete introductory sections of report
2. Implement Baseline Models
   1. NN-based model
   2. CNN-based model
   3. GAN-based model
3. Discuss results of baselines
4. Disucss future work
5. Maybe: begin testing non-tested implementations
